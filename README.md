# Coursera - Getting & Cleaning Data - Course Project
## Based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
### Created by snsavage

This project contains three files.  This readme file,
a codebook describing the project dataset and an r script, 
run_analysis.R, that will produce the completed datset.  

Information on the original dataset can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and the original dataset can be found 
[here] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

In order to use the run_analysis.R script, the file must be in the current 
working directory as set in R.  Also, the dataset will need to be downloaded
from the UCI website and saved in the same directory as the R script. 

Running the R script will produce a data file in the current working directory
called analysis_output.txt containing the final summarized dataset.
